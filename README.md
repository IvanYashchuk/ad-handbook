## Building the book

To build the HTML version of the book from R using the
`bookdown` package,

```
> library(bookdown)
> render_book('index.Rmd')
```

The first page of the book can then be found in the file
`_book/index.html`.

A web connection is required to render the mathematics in the web
version because it uses MathJax.

To build the PDF version of the book using a shell script,

```
> ./build-pdf.sh
```

and to build the HTML version,

```
> ./build-html.sh
```
